# Degree Project in Computer Science, KTH
## Comparison Between Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and a hybrid between them for the University Course Timetabling Problem
A repository containing the implementation of three heuristic algorithms solving the University Course Timetabling Problem, as a part of a Degree Project at KTH. The three algorithms are
* Simulated annealing
* Genetic algorithm
* Genetic Algorithm-Simulated Annealing hybrid
